# Parallel Web Crawler

I was given a Java implementation of a single-threaded web crawler
and unit tests for both a single-threaded and multi-threaded implementation
of the crawler. I used Java concurrency library, third-party packages, and
creational design patterns to implement a web crawler that takes 
advantage of multiple cores to parallelize its workload.

### Configuration File
